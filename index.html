          <p style="color: aliceblue;" class="text-intro">The Japanese word ‘rōnin’ describes a samurai without a
            master, who wanders alone. The status of a ronin varied across different time-periods. In a general sense,
            being a ronin implied failure. More specifically, a ronin had renounced the act of ‘seppuku’, which is a
            form of Japanese ritual suicide that was applied to restore honor after defeat. Those who refused seppuku
            became outcasts that endured a reputation of disgrace.</p>

              <p class="text-intro">Walking their own path, some ronin worked as mercenaries and bodyguards, and others
                became criminals. One of the most legendary ronin is <B>Miyamoto Musashi</B>, who is famed as Japan’s
                greatest swordsman - undefeated in more than 60 duels. Musashi became a ronin after he escaped death
                during the Battle of <b>Sekigahara</b> when serving general <b>Hideyori</b>. Aside from being a
                swordsman, he
                was also a philosopher, artist, and well-learned Buddhist.</p>

                <b>Never Stray From The Way</b><br>
                If you live a certain way, Either devote yourself wholly to it or cast it aside. If you can't bring
                yourself to place complete conviction in your actions then why do them?</p>
